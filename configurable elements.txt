elements can be databased:
	- we dont really care what the elements are because they dont have inherital function
	- we can have a database of elements
	- then target & use that element in the damage effect
	- we can have it show up in the editor the same way as they do now
	- just do Elements.values

Most other stats tho, are functional:
	- melee/distance stats might be able to be configured with the condition
	- but things like Life, Mana, Movement, Rage, idk
	- States definitely need additional code to check for them (unmovable, gravity, invisibility line of sight, fly/dig height, etc)

	but in the case of elements, i think we never need to directly address them like Elements.water
